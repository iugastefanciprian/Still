<b>Ideas: </b><br>
•	For the player we are going to use a 3D capsule, FPS perspective<br>
•	Level 1: Forest -> get it working first<br>
•	Level 2: Bunker(textures are less difficult and less detail required, also classic)<br>
•	Mechanics<br>
  •	Player: walk, crouch, toggle run<br>
  •	Enemy: <br>
    •	difficulty scaling (increase the hearing range, movement speed)<br>
    •	Enemy cannot see you if you are behind a crate, bush or tree and player is not moving<br>
    •	Monster is blind<br>
  •	Environment:<br>
    •	Areas in which you scale the volume<br>
